OpenVPN is an open-source Virtual Private Network (VPN) system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.
It allows peers to authenticate each other using pre-shared secret keys, certificates, or username/password.
It is recognized industry-wide as the most secure VPN encryption protocol.
As well as being remarkably secure, OpenVPN is highly customizable and can be implemented by the users in several ways.

The OpenVPN protocol is responsible for handling client-server communications.
It allows you to connect to a remote network over a secure, encrypted connection and mask your IP addresses over all ports.
When OpenVPN handles encryption and authentication, it uses the OpenSSL library quite extensively.

Setting up OpenVPN in Linux is fairly easy.
You can import its configuration from NetworkManager, _nm-connection-editor_ to be more specific.
The configuration of OpenVPN has `.openvpn` extension.
I want this blog to be a hands-on tutorial on how to import it.
So, letâ€™s get started.

First of all, you should download the OpenVPN configuration from a source.
They can be from any service provided you like, but for this blog, I will be using [vpnbook](https://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn) for the sake of simplicity.

![vpnbook screenshot](/images/vpnbook_screenshot.webp#center)

The picture shown above is the screenshot of the link to vpnbook provided above.
Download any OpenVPN Certificate Bundle from the provided ones according to your location and need.
I downloaded [US1 OpenVPN Certificate Bundle](https://www.vpnbook.com/free-openvpn-account/VPNBook.com-OpenVPN-US1.zip).
Now let's go ahead and look at the contents of the zip file you just downloaded.

![openvpn bundle contents](/images/openvpn_bundle_contents.webp#center)

The zip contained the files shown in the figure above.
As said on the website of vpnbook, these are _UDP 53_, _UDP 25000_, _TCP 80_, and _TCP 443_ profile.
For those of you who donâ€™t know it, TCP and UDP are protocols and the numbers beside them are the port in which they operate.
For example, `vpnbook-us1-udp53.openvpn` has a configuration for UDP protocol operating on port 53 for the VPN.

Now letâ€™s go ahead and import them from NetworkManager.
But hold on, have you installed the OpenVPN client needed to operate it?
If not then install the _openvpn_ package needed to operate the OpenVPN.
Since we are going to import them from NetworkManager, we need a plugin called _networkmanager-openvpn_, depending on which distribution you are on the package name may differ slightly and it may have been included inside the _networkmanager_ package also.
Since I am on Arch (I use Arch btw! ðŸ˜œ), those package names are of Arch.
So, go ahead and do some research for your distribution and install those prerequisites.

We will be importing the configuration from _nm-connection-editor_ command.
It is a NetworkManager GUI connection editor.
So, go ahead and enter _nm-connection-editor_ on your terminal or if you are not a fan of entering commands in the terminal, right-click your NetworkManager applet from your taskbar and click on _Edit Connectionsâ€¦_.
Now, you will see a window showing all of your previous network connections.
Click the **+** icon on the bottom left corner to add the connection.

Youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a connection type from the dropdown, which will default on _Ethernet_.
Choose "Import a saved VPN configuration" **not VPN** which is the last element in the dropdown for my case.
Then click _Create_.
This also shows a quick reminder for you to install openvpn plugin for NetworkManager if you havenâ€™t already as instructed above.

After clicking _Create_, you will be prompted to choose the openvpn configuration file.
Go ahead and show it the .openvpn file you chose earlier.
Quick info: **UDP is faster but can result in data loss and TCP is more reliable**.
Vpnbook instructs to use TCP if you cannot connect to UDP due to network restriction.
I am choosing `vpnbook-us1-udp53.openvpn` and importing it.
You can choose any one of the four files.

As you can see the network manager automatically imports the settings for you.
You donâ€™t have to manually type it.
The configuration just imported had a key and a certificate inside it.
So the network manager created them inside the `.cert` directory in your `$HOME` directory.
If you have a different file for your certificate and/or key then also network manager imports it in the configuration but you shouldnâ€™t move the certificate and the key file, since it stores its location in the configuration.
If you happen to move any of those files then you have to change its location from this configuration in _nm-connection-editor_.

Every OpenVPN service you use has a username and password associated with your account.
Since vpnbook has a common username and password for all the users, its username remains the same but its password changed from time to time.
So if youâ€™re using vpnbook and you cannot connect to the VPN service then chances are the password has been changed.
Now go ahead and copy the username and password from the [vpnbook](https://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn) and paste it into the configuration shown above.
You can change the _Connection name_ if you like but shouldnâ€™t change other fields if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re exactly doing.
Hit _Save_ when youâ€™re done.

Now when you click on the network manager applet on the taskbar, you can see the connection name for the VPN set above inside _VPN Connections_.
Click on the VPN you want to activate.
The network manager tries to connect you to the VPN selected.
The icon of the network manager applet also changes.

[vpnbook](https://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn) was chosen in this tutorial for the sake of simplicity.
It is free for everyone so it's extremely slow and you might not have established a successful VPN connection due to this.
You can try again if it didnâ€™t connect for the first time.

Right now, I have imported the [TunnelBear OpenVPN config files](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tunnelbear/linux/openvpn.zip) in the same way as above.
Here for username and password, you have to enter your email and password you used when creating an account on [TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/).
It gives you 500MB network transfer per month for free package users. For more, you have to pay for them.

You can also set up OpenVPN by moving the files to `/etc/openvpn/client` and starting the openvpn service from the command-line.
More about the process [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TunnelBear).
But I donâ€™t like to use root access if it can be done by any user.
The method described in this blog works for users without superuser privileges also.
The only place where superuser privileges are required is when installing the prerequisite packages.

So thatâ€™s it for today.
